# Respiratory Healthcare Tool

This tool is designed to assess a patient’s respiratory health based on their local air quality. To begin, enter the patient's zip code. The Air Quality Index category (i.e., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) for the patient’s region will populate the display.

The “Model Prediction for Cancer” model is used to predict a patient's risk of developing lung cancer (Low, Medium, High). Enter the severity of the patient's coughing and fatigue, and rate their diet on a scale of 1 to 8. Use the drop-down menus to select the patient’s smoking, level of obesity, and alcohol use. The air pollution value will automatically populate, based on the zip code that was entered. Click submit to determine the patient’s risk level for developing lung cancer.

The “Model Prediction for Asthma” model is used to predict the patient’s emergency department visit rate for severe asthma attacks. Re-enter the patient’s zip code, select their age group, then click submit to view their estimated emergency department visit rate. The rate is the number of emergency department visits for asthma per 10,000 individuals, adjusted for the age group.
